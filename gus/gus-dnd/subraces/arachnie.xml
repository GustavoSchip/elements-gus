      <p>The Arachnie are a rare and eerie subrace of tieflings, born from two primary origins. The first origin occurs when a humanoid mates with a yochlol, a handmaiden demon of Lolth, resulting in a child imbued with the essence of spiders. The second origin involves an unborn cambion exposed to an excess of Lolth's demonic influence, twisting its form and nature into that of an Arachnie.</p>
      <p>Known for their dual forms, the Arachnie can switch between a humanoid appearance and a spider-like form, each bringing distinct advantages and drawbacks. In humanoid form, they appear as other tieflings, though often with subtle hints of their spider heritage, such as dark, glossy eyes or elongated fingers. In their spider form, they become a terrifying blend of humanoid and arachnid, gaining enhanced abilities but also suffering from sunlight sensitivity.</p>
