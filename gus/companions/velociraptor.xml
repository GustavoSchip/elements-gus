			<p>The velociraptor is a feathered dinosaur that resembles a large turkey. It has a long, slender snout, sharp teeth, and a curved claw on each hind foot. It is covered in brown and black feathers, with a distinctive crest on its head. It has a long, stiff tail that helps it balance and maneuver. It is about 2 feet tall and 6 feet long, and weighs about 30 pounds.</p>
			<p class="indent">The velociraptor is an aggressive predator that often hunts in packs. It uses its speed and cunning to ambush and surround its prey. It has advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one of its allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally is not incapacitated. It can make two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claws. Its bite can pierce through flesh and bone, while its claws can slash and rend. If the target is a medium or smaller creature, the velociraptor can try to grapple it with its bite and drag it away.</p>
