### Gus
 My attempt at Homebrew for Aurora Builder

### Installing
 Use this link in the Aurora Builder 'ADDITIONAL CONTENT' tab: <br>
    ``` https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GustavoSchip/elements-gus/master/gus.index ```

### Requirements
 My homebrew requires at least the [core](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aurorabuilder/elements/master/core.index) content for Aurora Builder, but my preference goes to the new community driven [core](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AuroraLegacy/elements/master/core.index) content by [AuroraLegacy](https://github.com/AuroraLegacy) at [elements](https://github.com/AuroraLegacy/elements)
