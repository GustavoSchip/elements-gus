# Gus

My attempt at Homebrew for Aurora Builder

## Installing

Use this link in the Aurora Builder 'ADDITIONAL CONTENT' tab: <br> <!-- markdownlint-disable-line no-inline-html --> <!-- markdownlint-disable-line line-length -->
``` https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GustavoSchip/elements-gus/master/gus.index ``` <!-- markdownlint-disable-line line-length -->

### Requirements

My homebrew requires at least the [core](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aurorabuilder/elements/master/core.index)
content for Aurora Builder, but my preference goes to the new community
driven [core](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AuroraLegacy/elements/master/core.index) content <!-- markdownlint-disable-line line-length -->
by [AuroraLegacy](https://github.com/AuroraLegacy) at [elements](https://github.com/AuroraLegacy/elements)
